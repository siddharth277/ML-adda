# 3D Room Scene Semantic Segmentation Assignment- Siddharth Shukla

In this assignment, you’ll work with **3D indoor point clouds** and design a pipeline to segment room scenes into meaningful components (floor, walls, ceiling, furniture) using **geometry-based clustering only** — no deep learning.  
The focus is on spatial reasoning, clustering, and rule-based labeling.  

---

## Objective  

- Segment 3D room scenes into components using **unsupervised clustering**.  
- Use only geometry-based methods (no training, no neural networks).  
- Explore rules and heuristics to assign semantic labels to clusters.  

---

## Tasks  

### 1. Dataset & Preprocessing  
- Use `.ply` or `.pcd` files from **S3DIS** or any indoor 3D scene dataset.  
- Apply preprocessing steps:  
  - **Denoising** (e.g., statistical or radius outlier removal).  
  - **Voxel downsampling** to reduce point density.  

### 2. Scene Segmentation  
- Apply clustering:  
  - Options: **DBSCAN**, **Euclidean clustering**, or similar methods.  
- Assign **unique colors** to clusters for visualization.  
- Optionally filter clusters by size/shape to remove noise blobs.  

### 3. Rule-Based Labeling (Optional but Recommended)  
- Implement simple geometric heuristics:  
  - **Floor** → Lowest large flat horizontal surface.  
  - **Ceiling** → Highest large flat horizontal surface.  
  - **Walls** → Large vertical planes.  
  - **Furniture** → Mid-height clusters with moderate horizontal spread.  

### 4. Visualization  
- Visualize segmented scenes with **color-coded clusters**.  
- Save/export final segmented point cloud as `.ply` or `.pcd` with colors.

## Optional (Extra Credit)  

- Automatic semantic labeling based on orientation, position, size.  
- Compute **bounding boxes and dimensions** for furniture.  
- Generate a **2D top-down map** by projecting clusters onto the ground plane.  
- Build an **interactive viewer** (Open3D GUI or PyQT) for manual inspection/labeling.

## Submission and deadline
- Submit your work by committing your code to this repository within 3 days of accepting the assignment.
- Submissions made to personal repositories will not be reviewed; ensure all work is pushed to the designated repository provided for you.

## 💡 Notes  

- Keep it **geometry-only** — no pretrained models or deep learning.  
- Visual clarity matters; screenshots should clearly show separated components.  
- Rule-based labeling doesn’t need to be perfect — simple heuristics are fine.

Good luck! This assignment will test your ability to reason about **geometry and clustering** in 3D scenes.
